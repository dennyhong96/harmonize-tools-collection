              <p>
                A Non-Disclosure Agreement is a legally enforceable contract
                that protects information that should be kept secret. Examples
                include test results, software, passwords, and system
                specifications. The NDA includes a definition of what is
                considered confidential, what is excluded from confidentiality,
                the receiving partyâ€™s obligations, time periods, and choice of
                law.
              </p>
